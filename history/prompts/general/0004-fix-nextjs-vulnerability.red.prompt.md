## Prompt

crete a history of recent changes

## Response snapshot

Fixed Next.js vulnerability by updating frontend dependencies in package.json, specifically updating Next.js from 16.0.0 to ^16.0.1, cleaning up duplicate entries in tsconfig.json, and updating backend dependencies including FastAPI, SQLModel, and related packages to secure versions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Resolved Next.js security vulnerability and enabled successful Vercel deployment
- 🧪 Tests: Verified frontend builds successfully without security warnings
- 📁 Files: Updated package.json and tsconfig.json for frontend, updated backend dependencies
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Keeping dependencies updated is critical for security and deployment compatibility

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Vulnerable Next.js version causing Vercel deployment failure with security warning
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement automated dependency updates and security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
